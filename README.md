# Triangle Generator

This is an untitled passion project, and the first project of this size that I've created. I've been a math teacher for almost 10 years. One of the most annoying, time consuming parts of my job is creating well-formatted and consistent handouts, worksheets, tests and quizzes. This problem is SO MUCH WORSE when teaching trigonometry. I don't want to pay for software and worksheets out of my own pocket, and I don't want to fiddle with the specifics of drawing diagrams when I'm trying to make 50+ problems for a review package.

My goal with this project is to simplify the process of making triangle diagrams. No more Googling "sine law problem no ambiguous case" and "borrowing" 16 different diagrams from 16 different sources, then manually making solutions. The goal for this tool is to have a number of options that can be set, and one button that generates a consistent-looking, printer friendly diagram that can be copied into your word processor of choice.

## Current Goals:
- Right triangle problems
    - including solving for legs and hypotenuse using Pythagorean Theorem (Right Triangle Relationship) ✅
    - right angle can be in any of 4 corners ✅
    - random rotations
    - primary trig ratios
        - select sin/cos/tan/random
        - solve for side/angle/random
- Oblique triangle Problems
    - Cosine Law
    - Sine Law
        - toggle for ambiguous case

## Possible Extras:
Once the basic functionality is complete, I hope to add the following features:
- make specific diagrams to match examples/problems you want to assign
- optional solutions
- special triangle diagrams, ticks for equilateral and isosceles
- diagrams for area, similar triangles, medians/centroid, altitudes/orthocentre, circumcentre/circumcircle/perpendicular bisectors, incentre/incircle/angle bisectors, etc.
- generating whole pdf worksheets
- multi-step problems
- quiz mode?
